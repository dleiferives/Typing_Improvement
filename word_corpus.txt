Introduction:
Within my life there are three major experiences that have formed my decision for graduate study, and have shaped my character:  my personal battle with chronic disease, handling the complexities of mental illness within my family, and navigating financial hardship. These experiences have made me resilient, empathetic, and determined to create spaces where everyone supported and valued. At Cornell, I will apply what I've learned and contribute to a community of inclusion, belonging, and respect. Where scholars thrive through collaboration, diversity, and shared purpose.

Personal:
Sophomore year of my undergraduate studies, a fog rolled in. At first, it was minor, a restless night here, a sluggish day there. But before long, the clarity of my mind--my most reliable tool-- had dulled. I fought against it, but soon, the storm of exhaustion consumed everything. My grades crumbled, my friendships unattended, my once-shining dreams shadows. I was lost. 

That summer I worked in a lumber yard and I found space to reflect. I listened to the stories of my coworkers. They spoke with few pretenses, no façades. Just people, sharing who they were. When it was my turn to share, I realized I had little to say. I'd spent so long pushing against the fog that I ignored the growing pain in my body and the emptiness in my soul. 

When finally diagnosed with celiac disease, the storm broke. My health improved and I began to see clearly again. I saw someone who had suffered failures, grown, and yet had so much more to grow. I entered a period of deep self-reflection where I reassessed my priorities and my vision for the future. I came away from that summer elucidating four personal truths: life is too short to waste, health is non-negotiable, excellence is worth striving for, and people thrive in spaces where they are understood and respected. 

This ignited my decision to pursue graduate education. At Cornell, I will embody these truths, and promote a community of direct human connection where collaboration and academic rigor thrive alongside joy, self-reflection, and fulfillment.

Familial:
I have grown up watching my father’s battle with bipolarity, becoming deeply attuned to the invisible barriers that people living with mental health issues face. This topic is surrounded by stigma and misunderstanding. I’ve witnessed firsthand how difficult it is for someone who struggles with mental illness: and how painful it is to watch them feel judged and isolated.

In the winter quarter of my Junior year, my father lost his job and became homeless due to addiction and his unmanaged mental-health issues, and I simultaneously lost my healthcare coverage. These events significantly impacted my ability to focus on academics. Unable to withdraw due to scholarship requirements, I persevered and completed the term to the best of my ability under the difficult circumstances.  This experience proved to me my ability to succeed in academia no matter the circumstances, and solidified my path into higher-education.

As a result of these experiences I have volunteered with a support group for teens: who struggle with, or who have family who struggle with mental illness. Working with other volunteers to provide an inclusive and judgement free space, was deeply rewarding and taught me how to utilize my personal experiences to help others. 

Financial:
My family has long struggled with money. Most severely when I was in elementary school. To produce long term stability, my mother went to grad school at night. Witnessing this pursuit of higher education in order to provide, even while navigating through financial hardship, instilled within me a deep respect for the transformative power of education.

Fiscal constraints forced my undergraduate attendance of a state school. I have been supported in my pursuit of education by my community and the government, through scholarships and the Pell grant respectively. Without these resources, I would be unable to pursue education without incurring major debt. Informed by these experiences, I actively work to pass along this kindness and reduce barriers to education. This is why I want to eventually become a professor, and why I currently mentor and tutor students in my community for free.


Conclusion:
Holistically, these experiences have deepened my resolve for both graduate studies, and supporting anyone in need.  They have shaped my vision for a future where education serves as a catalyst for growth, understanding, and inclusivity. At Cornell, I am eager to channel these lessons into meaningful contributions, promoting a community where resilience, empathy, and shared purpose empower every scholar to thrive.

These experiences tested my perseverance under extreme stress, demonstrated my determination for success. And holistically, deepened my resolve to pursue graduate studies.

This experience reinforced how important it is to cultivate a feeling of belonging, where respect is prioritized, and where the goal is to learn and grow together. We can’t always see the invisible struggles that others are facing, but by creating environments where empathy and respect are the foundation, we can ensure that everyone has the opportunity to thrive.
